# Emergency Call Data Analysis and Visualization using Python
🚨 Emergency Call Data Analysis and Visualization using Python

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real 911 emergency call data from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, sourced from Kaggle
.
The goal is to uncover insights about emergency call patterns by type, location, and time, and to visualize these patterns for better understanding of public safety trends.

📊 Project Overview

The dataset includes details such as latitude, longitude, description, timestamp, township, and call title.
Using Python and key data science libraries, the project transforms, analyzes, and visualizes the data to identify major emergency reasons (EMS, Fire, Traffic) and their occurrence trends over time.

Key focus areas include:

📅 Time-Series Analysis: Extracted hour, month, and weekday patterns to study temporal call distributions.

🏘️ Geographic Insights: Identified top zip codes and townships with the highest call volumes.

🚑 Reason Categorization: Grouped calls into major emergency types (EMS, Fire, Traffic) for trend comparison.

🔥 Data Visualization: Created count plots, line charts, heatmaps, and clustermaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning and feature engineering using Pandas and NumPy

Temporal feature extraction from datetime objects

💡 Summary

This project showcases how Python can transform raw emergency response data into meaningful visual insights.
By analyzing trends across time, location, and category, it helps identify peak emergency periods and key operational areas — providing valuable groundwork for public safety optimization and data-driven decision-making.
